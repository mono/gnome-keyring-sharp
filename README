gnome-keyring-sharp is a fully managed implementation of libgnome-keyring.

D-Bus integration
-----------------

When the NDesk.DBus library and C# 2.0 build environment is detected,
gnome-keyring-sharp will be built with D-Bus support.

In this mode of operation, D-Bus is used to determine the socket address
of the keyring daemon, which can be more reliable than taking the value
provided in an environment variable (which is still done as a fallback if
D-Bus is not running).

This optional dependency can be found at http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp
and is widely packaged by distributions.
